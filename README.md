# F_Logit_R
Functional logistic regression analysis.

This repo contains the R code used for the simulations in the manuscript "A robust functional principal component analysis for scalar-on-function regression". It also includes classical functional partial least squares, functional principal component analysis, and a robust functional partial least squares methods.
